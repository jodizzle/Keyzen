#if the input string is preprocessed with shift it won't have to check uppper
#find out how the time changes for longer input strings/more capitals
#once the is a coordList find areas where things are on 1 finger and calculate them together without looking for what hand they are on
#make mobileCoordTest return the keyboard?
#remove extra totalDistance = 0 lines?
#are there even letters that are pressed by both?
#should I replace every function call with in program alternatives?
preprocess coordList to just calculate the distances of all 1 finger sections together? not sure if this changes the total number of calculations
#numCoord global or not?
#probably would take around 5 hours do to a 5 bounded bfs, colemak changes 27, dvorak 33
#pickling results
identify rounding error, possibly don't need so many significant figures
#kalq test, and kalq style test
#add a timeit funciton at the beginning of the for loop and also find out how long the beginning of the program takes
#for resultsTraverser have the top 2 results with percents for letter placement

accurately rename functions and variables more
heatmap
test small keyboard?
work on duplicatesExist

#work on a better visualizer using knowledge from graphics class
#figure out what data type the visualizer should accept, or which different data types
have the visualizer display a correctly sized spacebar

~IMPORTANT~
work out how mating should function
===instead of recalculating input string every time just check changes
randomGradient probably does a ton of shuffleing, check if that is necessary
#create a model where certain keys can't be changed
run this continuously on spare computer
add support for the mod key on iphone keyboards
calculate time spent on what rows, letter frequencies, bigraph frequencies
calculate time spent in what zones instead of rows on normal keyboards
correct spreadkeys by having it prioritize important keys
