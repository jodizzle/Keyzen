#if the input string is preprocessed with shift it won't have to check uppper
calculate time spent on what rows, letter frequencies, bigraph frequencies
#find out how the time changes for longer input strings/more capitals
#once the is a coordList find areas where things are on 1 finger and calculate them together without looking for what hand they are on
#make mobileCoordTest return the keyboard?
#remove extra totalDistance = 0 lines?
#are there even letters that are pressed by both?
#should I replace every function call with in program alternatives?
3preprocess coordList to just calculate the distances of all 1 finger sections together? not sure if this changes the total number of calculations
#numCoord global or not?
#probably would take around 5 hours do to a 5 bounded bfs, colemak changes 27, dvorak 33
#pickling results
identify rounding error, possibly don't need so many significant figures
#kalq test, and kalq style test
#add a timeit funciton at the beginning of the for loop and also find out how long the beginning of the program takes
#for resultsTraverser have the top 2 results with percents for letter placement

accurately rename functions and variables more

===instead of recalculating input string every time just check changes
randomGradient does a ton of shuffleing, check if that is necessary
create a model where certain keys can't be changed
run this continuously on spare computer
