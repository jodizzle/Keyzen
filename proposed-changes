#if the input string is preprocessed with shift it won't have to check uppper
calculate time spent on what rows, letter frequencies, bigraph frequencies
#find out how the time changes for longer input strings/more capitals
#once the is a coordList find areas where things are on 1 finger and calculate them together without looking for what hand they are on
#make mobileCoordTest return the keyboard?
remove extra totalDistance = 0 lines?
are there even letters that are pressed by both?

accurately rename functions and variables more
should I replace every function call with in program alternatives?
preprocess coordList to just calculate the distances of all 1 finger sections together? not sure if this changes the total number of calculations

probably would take around 5 hours do to a 5 bounded bfs, colemak changes 27, dvorak 33
identify rounding error, possibly don't need so many significant figures

heatmap
mating
test small keyboard

numCoord global or not?

kalq test, and kalq style test
instead of recalculating input string every time just check changes

pickling results

add a timeit funciton at the beginning of the for loop and also find out how long the beginning of the program takes
for resultsTraverser have the top 2 results with percents for letter placement
work on a better visualizer using knowledge from images
create a model where certain keys can't be changed

work on duplicatesExist
